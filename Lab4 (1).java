lab 4
cis 200 sec B
Within the provided file (Lab4.java), the following has been done for you: Declare and initialize a 2D
array of doubles to hold the values listed in the lookup table above. Study the code and ask a TA if you
do not understand what is being done.
Then,
- Declare a constant to hold the number of clients (5).
- Use a for loop to read in info for 5 separate clients. For each client, ask the user to input the clientâ€™s
name (store in a String array), the amount to be invested (assume int $100-$10,000) the interest rate
(assume int 5-10 percent) and the term (years) of the investment (assume int 1-10). Store these last 3
values in either 3 separate, parallel int arrays or a single 2D array. (You will, therefore, either have 4
single-dimensional arrays or 1 single-D and 1 multi-D array)
- After all values have been entered in for all 5 clients, use another for loop for your output. Use the 2D
lookup table to determine the Compound Value and the Compound Interest earned by each client and
display with a $-sign and 2 decimals (along with their name)
for part 2 :
add f the amount to
be invested ($100-$10,000, inclusive) the interest rate (5%-10%, inclusive) and the term (years) of the
investment (1-10, inclusive). If invalid, display an error message and require the user to re-enter the value
until the value is valid. A piece of data must be valid before moving on to the next. For example, if
investment amount is invalid, loop until a valid value is entered, THEN move on to interest rate.
